# UC Davis : MAT167py

Welcome to Math 167!

This website is a browser-based python notebook environment for MAT167.

[Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) offer a clean way to interleave **markdown** and **python** code.  More specifically, this website uses [JupyterLite] which includes a web-based python runtime (runs code in browser, no installs required).

TODO: How to submit homework, reload template.

TODO: Add pointers for setting up python/jupyter locally, for folks who are interested.
